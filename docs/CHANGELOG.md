## [2026-04-16]
### Added — Overworld Weather System
- **WeatherRenderer system** (`frontend/src/systems/WeatherRenderer.ts`): Renders visual weather effects on the overworld using Phaser particle emitters and camera-fixed overlays. Supports 6 weather types: rain (diagonal blue droplets), sandstorm (horizontal dust), snow (drifting flakes), fog (pulsing white overlay), sunshine (warm tint + lens flare), and none.
- **MapDefinition `weather` field**: Optional `weather?: OverworldWeather` field on `MapDefinition` interface for per-map weather configuration.
- **OverworldScene integration**: WeatherRenderer created during `create()` and updated each frame. Weather automatically set from map definition.
- **Map weather assignments**: Route 6 (rain), Route 7 (fog), Ember Mines (sandstorm).

## [2026-04-16]
### Added — Overworld Abilities System
- **OverworldAbilities.ts**: New system for field moves (Cut, Surf, Strength, Flash, Fly, Rock Smash) with badge requirements and party move checks.
- **New tile types**: CUT_TREE (110), CRACKED_ROCK (111), STRENGTH_BOULDER (112) added to Tile enum, SOLID_TILES, OVERLAY_BASE, and FOREGROUND_TILES.
- **Cut and Rock Smash interactions**: Tile-based interactions in OverworldScene.tryInteract() that remove obstacles and show popup text.
- **Surf support**: Surfing state in OverworldScene with modified collision check to allow water tile traversal; auto-disembark on non-water tiles.
- **Helper methods**: redrawTile() for live tile replacement, showFieldAbilityPopup() for ability-use feedback.

## [2026-04-16]
### Added — NPC Behaviors & Emote System
- **NPCBehavior system** (`frontend/src/systems/NPCBehavior.ts`): Four behavior types — `stationary`, `look-around` (random facing every 2-5s), `wander` (random 1-tile moves within radius every 3-8s), `pace` (follows fixed direction route every 2s). `NPCBehaviorController` class manages per-NPC timers and movement with collision checking.
- **EmoteBubble system** (`frontend/src/systems/EmoteBubble.ts`): Six emote types (`exclamation`, `question`, `heart`, `sweat`, `music`, `zzz`) rendered as styled text above sprites. Pop-in tween (scale 0→1) with auto-fade and destroy.
- **NpcSpawn `behavior` field**: Added optional `behavior?: NPCBehaviorConfig` to `NpcSpawn` interface in `shared.ts`.
- **OverworldScene wiring**: Behavior controllers created during `spawnNPCs()`, updated every frame via `update()`, cleaned up in `respawnNPCs()`.
- **Sample NPC behaviors**: Pallet Town `pallet-npc-1` (look-around), Route 1 `route1-npc-2` (wander, radius 2), Viridian City `viridian-npc-1` (pace left-left-right-right).

## [2026-04-16]
### Added — Phase 9 Completion: Story & Quest Wiring

Warps added to Voltara, Wraithmoor, Scalecrest, and Cinderfall cities.
- **Quest HUD Tracker (QuestTrackerScene.ts)**: Overlay scene showing active quest name and current step in the top-right corner. Auto-updates on flag-set and quest-completed events. Launched automatically from OverworldScene.
- **QuestJournalScene + QuestTrackerScene registration**: Both scenes now properly registered in game-config.ts (QuestJournalScene was missing from Phaser scene list).
- **Quest step trigger automation**: Added `triggerFlag` to Volcanic Survey vents (5 steps), Dragon's Lament herb/mineral, and Chef's Special berries. Added `triggerEvent` to Captain Stern engine parts (trainer-defeated events). All auto-complete via QuestManager's existing observer pattern.
- **Quest interaction NPCs**: Conduit repair points (3) in Voltara City for Power Restoration quest. Memory fragment pickups (3) in Wraithmoor Town for Restless Spirit quest. Volcanic vent recording points (5) in Victory Road for Volcanic Survey quest. Herb pickup in Verdantia Village and mineral pickup in Ember Mines for Dragon's Lament quest.

- **Route 8 Ace Trainers**: 2 new trainer entries (ace-trainer-4 Rex, ace-trainer-5 Luna, Lv 37–39) for Stormbreak Pass.
- **Map connection chain update**: Cinderfall → Route 8 → Victory Road → Aether Sanctum. Crystal Cavern ↔ Crystal Cavern Depths. All warps and spawn points bidirectional.

### Fixed
- **CUT_TREE/CRACKED_ROCK/STRENGTH_BOULDER tile colors**: Added missing `TILE_COLORS` entries for field ability target tiles (IDs 110–112), fixing map-data test failures.
- **shadow-ball move reference**: Replaced invalid `shadow-ball` move on ace-trainer-5 with `night-shade` (valid Ghost move), fixing data-integrity test.

### Added — Phase 15: Sound & Music Expansion
- **Procedural Pokémon Cry Generator (CryGenerator.ts)**: Runtime synthesis of 151 unique chip-tune cries using Web Audio API. Each Pokémon's cry is deterministic (seeded by dex number + base stat total) with multi-pulse envelopes, frequency sweeps, and vibrato. Hand-tuned parameters for starter families, algorithmic generation for all others.
- **Expanded audio keys**: 13 new BGM keys (rival/legendary/villain battle themes, 5 town variants, cave, evolution, credits, victory road, villain lair) and 14 new SFX keys (stat raise/lower, status inflict, synthesis activate, item obtain, badge get, heal jingle, save, Pokédex register, 4 footstep types, water splash).
- **Context-sensitive music**: Distinct BGM per town theme (coastal, industrial, spooky, mountain, cave). Updated MAP_BGM mapping for all 30+ maps.
- **AudioManager enhancements**: `playFanfare()` (fade BGM → play jingle → restore), `playLoHpWarning()`/`stopLoHpWarning()` (layered beep over BGM), `pauseBGM()`/`resumeBGM()`, `playSFXWithRate()` for pitch-shifted variants, `previousBGMKey` tracking.
- **Procedural audio placeholders (ProceduralAudio.ts)**: Runtime generation of placeholder audio buffers for missing BGM/SFX keys, with mood-based BGM (7 moods) and profile-based SFX patterns.

### Added — Phase 16: Advanced Battle Features
- **Synthesis Mode (SynthesisHandler.ts + synthesis-data.ts)**: The game's unique "Mega Evolution" equivalent. 19 eligible Pokémon with +100 BST thematic boosts, optional type/ability overrides. One activation per battle, reverts on faint/battle-end. Includes starter final evos, gym leader aces, legendaries, and fan favorites (Gengar, Alakazam, Machamp, etc.).
- **Double Battle system (DoubleBattleManager.ts)**: Full 2v2 battle manager with 4 active slots, priority+speed turn ordering, spread move targeting (0.75× damage reduction), tag battle support with NPC ally parties, multi-trainer enemy configs, and slot-based faint/replacement tracking. BattleState expanded with EXECUTE_TURN and REPLACE states.
- **Move Tutor & TM system (tm-data.ts)**: 50 reusable TMs across all types (8 gym rewards, route pickups, shop purchases). 5 Move Tutor NPCs in key cities. `canLearnMove()` compatibility function with universal move set, type matching, and per-Pokémon override lists. Heart Scale item for Move Reminder.

### Added — Previous (same day)
- **Professor Intro Scene (IntroScene.ts)**: Classic "Welcome to the world of Pokémon!" multi-slide professor intro with animated fade transitions between slides, Professor Willow sprite, and Pokémon showcase. Includes typewriter-style text progression, mobile tap support, and smooth transitions.
- **Character Naming Screen**: After the professor intro, players type their name (max 10 characters) with a blinking cursor, preset quick-picks (Red, Ash, Gold, Ethan), keyboard and tap input, and a DONE button. Defaults to "Red" if left empty. Name saved to GameManager and used throughout the game.
- **Confirmation Slide**: Final slide confirms the player's name with a farewell message before transitioning to the overworld via white flash + fade.
- **Move Animation System (MoveAnimationPlayer.ts)**: Data-driven battle move animations with 6 animation styles (contact, projectile, beam, area, self, shake). 18 type-based default particle color palettes. 16 specific move overrides for signature moves (Earthquake, Hyper Beam, Thunder, Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Blizzard, Hydro Pump, Surf, Psychic, Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, Explosion, Self-Destruct, Dream Eater, Solar Beam, Thunderbolt). Screen flash and screen shake effects for high-impact moves. All animations play before damage is applied in BattleUIScene.
- **Running Shoes**: GridMovement now supports a running state at ~1.8× walk speed (55% of normal tween duration). Hold SHIFT to run in the overworld. Running requires the `runningShoes` game flag.
- **Running Shoes Gift**: Mom in Pallet Town player house gives Running Shoes after the player receives their starter Pokémon (flag-gated dialogue with `setFlag` support).
- **flagDialogue setFlag support**: NPC flag-gated dialogue entries can now optionally set a flag on interaction via the `setFlag` field, enabling item/ability grants through NPC conversations.

### Changed
- **New Game flow**: Selecting "New Game" on the title screen now launches IntroScene (professor intro → naming → confirmation → overworld) instead of going directly to the overworld.
- **Battle move execution flow**: BattleUIScene now plays move animations via `playMoveAnimation()` before calling `MoveExecutor.execute()`, adding visual flair to every attack. The execution logic was refactored into a separate `applyMoveResult()` method for clarity.
- **Development plan expanded (plan.md)**: Added Phases 10–20 covering: First Impressions & New Game Experience, Battle Animation & Visual Effects, Overworld Atmosphere & World Feel, Player Movement & Exploration, UI Art & Custom Pixel Font, Sound & Music Expansion, Advanced Battle Features (Synthesis Mode, Double Battles, Battle Tower), Cutscene System, Pokémon Personality & Bond System, World Enrichment & Side Activities, and Achievement & Completion Tracking.

## [2026-04-13]
### Fixed
- **Starter Pokémon missing in battle**: Back sprites for the chosen starter were never loaded because StarterSelectScene only preloaded front sprites, and MapPreloader ran before the party had any Pokémon. Now StarterSelectScene loads both front and back sprites for all starters.
- **BattleScene sprite safety net**: Added `init()`/`preload()` to BattleScene so it loads any missing player/enemy front+back sprites before rendering, preventing invisible Pokémon in edge cases.

### Added
- **Bug Catcher sprite** (`npc-bug-catcher`): New palette-swapped sprite with green/olive nature tones for Bug Catcher trainers.
- **Ace Trainer sprites** (`npc-ace-trainer`, `npc-ace-trainer-f`): Male and female Ace Trainer sprites with bold red/elite look.
- **Unique Gym Leader sprites**: `npc-gym-brock` (dark earthy tones), `npc-gym-blitz` (electric blue/yellow), `npc-gym-ferris` (steel gray/forge orange) — each gym leader now visually distinct from generic NPCs.
- **Admin Vex sprite** (`npc-admin-vex`): Dark purple outfit, distinct from regular Synthesis Grunts.
- **Synthesis Grunt sprite** (`npc-grunt`): Dark purple/magenta menacing palette swap, distinct from scientists and Admin Vex.
- **Marina sprite** (`npc-marina`): Blue/teal research assistant palette, unique from generic Lass trainers.
- **Psychic sprite** (`npc-psychic`): Dark purple mystical palette for Psychic trainer class.
- **Rival sprite overhaul**: Rival Kael now has a distinct blue-toned sprite instead of sharing identical pixels with Professor Oak.

### Changed
- **NPC sprite audit & reassignment**: Comprehensive review of all trainer sprite assignments.
- Bug Catchers (5) now use `npc-bug-catcher` instead of generic `npc-male-3`.
- Synthesis Grunts (6) now use `npc-grunt` instead of `npc-scientist`.
- Admin Vex (2 encounters) now uses `npc-admin-vex` instead of `npc-scientist`.
- Ace Trainer Victor/Rex use `npc-ace-trainer`; Ace Trainer Luna uses `npc-ace-trainer-f`.
- Gym Leader Brock, Blitz, and Ferris each have unique sprites.
- Marina (secondary rival) uses `npc-marina` instead of generic `npc-lass`.
- Psychic Elena uses `npc-psychic` instead of generic sprite.
- Blitz story NPC in Voltara City uses `npc-gym-blitz` instead of `npc-scientist`.
- `npc-scientist` reduced from 13+ characters to just actual scientists/engineers (lab aides, Dr. Ash, Voltara engineers).
- Updated all map files (routes 4-7, ember-mines, voltara-city, route-6) with correct sprite keys.

### Fixed
- **Rival/Professor identity crisis**: `rival.png` was pixel-identical to `npc-professor.png` — rival Kael now has a distinct palette.
- **Gender mismatch**: Ace Trainer Luna (female) was using male sprite `npc-male-5` → now uses `npc-ace-trainer-f`.
- **Gender mismatch**: Camper Rosa (female) was using male sprite `npc-male-1` → now uses `npc-female-4`.
- **Psychic Elena** was using generic `npc-female-3` → now uses dedicated `npc-psychic` sprite.

## [2026-04-13]
### Fixed
- **Mobile dialogue stuck**: A/B touch buttons now advance dialogue and battle UI on mobile. Added `update()` polling of `TouchControls.consumeConfirm/Cancel` in DialogueScene and BattleUIScene since raw DOM touch events bypass Phaser's scene-scoped pointer system.
- **Dialogue re-trigger on tap**: Added resume cooldown (2 frames) and touch input drain in OverworldScene so tapping to close dialogue doesn't immediately re-open a new conversation with the same NPC.

### Changed
- **Mobile controls: restored A/B buttons** alongside joystick, tap-to-confirm, and menu hamburger button. A (green, confirm) and B (red, cancel) buttons are back in both the in-canvas overlay (bottom-right) and the DOM control bar. Taps on A/B buttons are excluded from tap-to-confirm detection.
- **Pallet Town**: Expanded map from 25×20 to 25×30 with a southern dock and sea area. Path from Oak's Lab opens south to a wooden pier (DOCK_PLANK tiles) extending into the ocean. Shore has proper sand → wet sand → water transitions with a palm tree. Added Fisherman Wade NPC on the dock (gives Old Rod), and a pier sign.
- **Route 1**: Complete ground redesign with coherent design zones. North has dense contiguous meadows flanking the path; upper-mid has a solid east meadow block with ledge shortcut; center has organized flower beds forming a clearing (Rook rest area); lower section has a large east meadow block; south is clean and open near Pallet. Replaced scattered random grass/rock/bush placements with intentional natural formations. Repositioned trainers to guard meadow edges.
- **Route 2**: Complete ground redesign with four clear zones. North has dense forest-edge meadows on both sides; cave area has a solid cliff-face wall with a dark cave mouth opening (cliff surrounds cave floor tiles like a proper Pokemon cave entrance); center has a symmetrical flower clearing for the Marina rival battle; south has contiguous west and east meadow blocks with a ledge shortcut. South border changed from trees to fence line matching Viridian City boundary style. Repositioned trainers to guard meadows.

### Fixed
- **Pewter City**: Fixed row 19 width mismatch (31→30 chars). All rows now consistently 30 characters wide. Fixed east exit path to Route 3 with proper connectivity.
- **Viridian City**: Fixed rows 14 and 19 width mismatches (29→30 chars). All rows now consistently 30 characters wide.
- **Route 3 (Tide Pool Path)**: Complete ground redesign — sand, wet sand, and tide pool tiles now correctly border the water on the west coast instead of floating disconnected in the middle. Two distinct coastal beach sections separated by an inland meadow. Path properly connects north-south with smooth bends. Updated swimmer/fisherman NPC positions to be near the coastline.

### Added
- **Pewter City PokéMart**: Added PokéMart building exterior (MMMMMM tiles) next to PokéCenter, with matching interior map, warp, and spawn point. Created `pewter-pokemart.ts` and registered in map index.
- **Crystal Cavern crystals**: Added AETHER_CRYSTAL (÷) formations scattered throughout the cave, making it visually distinct as a crystal cavern rather than a plain cave.
- **Route 1 Rook NPC**: Added Rook's first story appearance at route midpoint — heals party, mysterious dialogue, appears after receiving starter (`requireFlag: 'receivedStarter'`).

### Changed
- **Mobile controls: replaced A/B buttons with joystick + tap-to-confirm**. Removed the A and B action buttons from both the in-canvas overlay and the DOM control bar. Tapping anywhere on screen now acts as spacebar/confirm for dialog advancement and world interactions. The virtual joystick remains for movement (activates on left 60% of screen). Added SPACE as a confirm key in InputManager alongside ENTER. Updated overworld HUD hints for mobile.

### Added
- **Extended tileset**: Expanded tileset.png from 70 to 110 frames, providing textured tiles for all Phase 4.5 biome types (Coastal, Volcanic, Mine, Industrial, Forest, Electric, Ghost/Ruin, Dragon, Synthesis HQ, League)
- **24 distinct NPC sprite atlases**: Generated individual character sprite atlases from M_01-M_12 and F_01-F_12 source sheets: npc-mom, npc-nurse, npc-professor, npc-scientist, npc-hiker, npc-swimmer, npc-sailor, npc-oldman, npc-lass, npc-male-1 through npc-male-6, npc-female-1 through npc-female-9
- **NPC sprite diversity**: Updated 175+ NPC and trainer textureKey/spriteKey assignments across all maps and trainer-data.ts (nurses, professors, gym leaders, quest givers, route trainers, dungeon NPCs all now have visually distinct sprites)
- **Mobile DOM controls below canvas**: On portrait mobile, the game canvas now anchors to the top of the screen and a dedicated touch-controls bar appears in the previously-black space below. Includes a floating virtual joystick (left zone) and A/B action buttons (right side).
- **Adaptive layout**: Controls automatically switch between the below-canvas DOM bar (portrait, >100 px of space) and the existing in-canvas overlay (landscape or desktop). Responds to orientation changes and window resize.

### Fixed
- **NPC/Trainer facing sprites**: NPCs and trainers now display the correct sprite frame matching their `facing` direction on spawn and when turning. Previously all NPCs showed the default frame regardless of facing direction, so trainers with line-of-sight checks appeared to look the wrong way.
- **Mobile canvas centering**: Switched from `CENTER_BOTH` to `CENTER_HORIZONTALLY` on touch devices so the canvas sits at the top of the viewport, maximizing the area available for controls.

### Fixed
- **Double-tap zoom**: Blocked `dblclick` and Safari gesture events to prevent accidental zoom-in on mobile that couldn't be reversed due to touch controls consuming pinch gestures.
- **Long-press copy/select**: Added `user-select: none`, `-webkit-touch-callout: none` on html/body/canvas and blocked `contextmenu` event to prevent accidental text selection and copy sheet on mobile.
- **Battle continue stuck on mobile**: `waitForConfirmThen()` in BattleUIScene now listens for `pointerdown` (tap) in addition to keyboard events, fixing the inability to dismiss the "Press Enter to continue" screen on touch devices.
- **Mobile battle prompt text**: Changed "Press Enter to continue..." to "Tap to continue..." on mobile devices.

---

## [2026-04-12]
### Fixed
- **Map edge openings**: Replaced solid tree/wall borders adjacent to warp exits with grass/floor tiles across all 51 maps, creating visible path openings at every map transition point.
- **Path connectivity in cities**: Added continuous PATH tile walkways connecting main roads to edge exits in viridian-city, pewter-city, ironvale-city, voltara-city, wraithmoor-town, scalecrest-citadel, cinderfall-town.
- **Pewter museum path**: Shrunk museum from 5 to 4 tiles wide to route south path alongside it to exit.
- **Dungeon entrances**: Widened cave entrance openings in victory-road, crystal-cavern, ember-mines and cleared interior wall obstructions.
- **Coral Harbor**: Closed false south exit opening on row 29 and ensured proper path to south warp tiles.

## [2026-04-12]
### Added
- **Proximity-based map preloading (MapPreloader system)**: New `MapPreloader` system in `frontend/src/systems/` that defers Pokémon front/back sprite loading from boot to on-demand, based on map proximity. Reduces initial boot asset count from 453 images to 151 (icons only). Front/back sprites are loaded per-map when entering a new area, and preloaded in the background when the player is within 8 tiles of a warp exit.
- **On-demand sprite loading in StarterSelectScene**: Starter Pokémon front sprites are loaded just-in-time if not already cached.
- **On-demand sprite loading in PokedexScene**: Pokémon front sprites load lazily when viewing a Pokédex entry.

### Changed
- **PreloadScene**: No longer loads all 302 Pokémon front/back sprites at boot; only loads icon sprites. Core assets (tilesets, player atlas, NPC atlases, audio) remain in the boot preload.
- **OverworldScene**: Integrates MapPreloader — calls `ensureMapReady()` on map create (loads current map encounters + player party sprites), `preloadAdjacentMaps()` for fire-and-forget background loading of connected maps, and `checkProximity()` on each player step for warp-proximity preloading.

## [2026-04-12]
### Added
- **Virtual joystick for mobile**: Replace static D-pad with a dynamic virtual joystick that appears at the user's touch location in the overworld. Drag to move in 4 cardinal directions; auto-hides on release.
- **Mobile-scaled UI**: Added `mobileFontSize()`, `MOBILE_SCALE`, and `isMobile()` helpers in theme.ts. Menus, battle actions, dialogue, and move lists all scale up 1.35× on touch devices for readability.
- **Tap-to-advance dialogue**: DialogueScene now responds to touch/tap to advance text and make choices.
- **Tappable close/exit buttons**: InventoryScene, PokedexScene, ShopScene, and PCScene now show prominent tappable close buttons on mobile instead of keyboard-only hints.
- **Larger A/B action buttons**: Touch control action buttons (confirm/cancel) increased from 52px to 72px with bigger labels for easier tapping.
- **Multi-touch support**: Enabled 3 active pointers in Phaser config so joystick and action buttons work simultaneously.
- **VirtualJoystick.ts**: New UI component in `frontend/src/ui/` for the floating joystick with dead zone, angle-based 4-way direction, and mouse fallback for desktop testing.

### Changed
- **TouchControls.ts**: Rewrote to use VirtualJoystick instead of static D-pad. Joystick is hidden during menus. Action buttons repositioned and enlarged.
- **BattleUIScene**: Action and move menu items scaled for mobile with padding for touch targets.
- **TitleScene**: Menu items scaled and padded for mobile touch.
- **MenuScene**: Panel and menu items scale with MOBILE_SCALE for touch devices.

## [2026-04-12]
### Added
- **Rival encounters placed on maps**: Kael rival-1 in Oak's Lab (post-starter trigger), Kael rival-2 on Route 3 (Tide Pool Path), Kael tag-battle NPC in Ironvale City (story-gated), Kael rival-5 on Victory Road entrance, Marina encounter on Route 2
- **7 missing quest definitions**: Added Captain Stern's Engine, The Chef's Special, Power Restoration, The Restless Spirit, The Dragon's Lament, Volcanic Survey, and The Father's Trail to quest-data.ts (12 total quests now defined)
- **Dr. Ash NPC**: Placed Volcanologist Dr. Ash in Cinderfall Town as Volcanic Survey quest giver with flag-gated dialogue
- **Phase 9 in plan.md**: New "Story & Quest Wiring" phase documenting rival placement, quest definitions, and itemized remaining work (quest step automation, quest UI, house interiors, Route 8/post-game maps)

### Fixed
- **Map connection audit & fixes**: Audited all 51 maps (195 warps, 123 spawn points) for connection integrity.
  - Fixed default spawn in viridian-city landing on GYM_ROOF tile — moved to PATH.
  - Fixed default spawn in pewter-city landing on GYM_WALL tile — moved to PATH.
  - Fixed default spawn in pewter-museum landing on DISPLAY_CASE tile — moved to FLOOR.
  - Fixed coral-harbor north warps to route-3 landing on TREE tiles — moved to PATH opening.
  - Fixed coral-harbor PokéMart warp on MART_WALL — moved to MART_DOOR tile.
  - Fixed gym warp tiles in coral-harbor, ironvale-city, verdantia-village, voltara-city, wraithmoor-town, scalecrest-citadel, and cinderfall-town from GYM_WALL to GYM_DOOR.
  - Updated all corresponding from-gym and from-pokemart spawn points to align with corrected door positions.
  - Opened victory-road north wall (rows 0–1) to create passable entrance for Pokémon League warps and from-league spawn.
- **Battle trainer sprite size**: Increased enemy trainer sprite scale from 1.5 to 3 so the trainer appears larger than the Pokémon, and increased alpha from 0.7 to 0.85 for better visibility.
- **Difficulty screen overlay**: Made difficulty selection background fully opaque so title screen no longer bleeds through. Disabled title menu keyboard/pointer handlers while difficulty screen is open and restored them on cancel.

### Changed
- **Map file organization**: Moved 51 map definition files from flat `data/maps/` into `cities/`, `routes/`, `interiors/`, and `dungeons/` subdirectories. Updated all imports in `index.ts` and `../shared` references.

### Fixed
- **ShopScene tab navigation**: Added LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to switch between Buy/Sell tabs (previously only Q/E worked), updated hint text
- **Nurse Joy counter interaction**: Extended NPC interaction check to reach across counter tiles (COUNTER, PINK_COUNTER), allowing players to talk to NPCs behind counters

### Added
- **Phase 6 — Difficulty modes**: Classic, Hard (Lv+4, smart AI, no items in trainer battles, 0.75× money), Nuzlocke (permadeath, first-encounter-only). Difficulty selection on New Game.
- **Phase 8 — Act 3+4 maps**: Route 6, Wraithmoor (Gym 6 Ghost—Morwen), Route 7 (Vex #2, Rook reveal), Scalecrest (Gym 7 Dragon—Drake), Cinderfall (Gym 8 Fire—Solara), Victory Road, Pokémon League (Elite Four Nerida + Champion Aldric). 9 interior maps. Encounter tables for Route 6/7/Victory Road. 15+ new trainers.

### Fixed
- **PC missing from Oak's Lab**: Added a PC terminal at the right-side lab machine so players can access the Pokémon Storage System from the lab
- **Pokéball placement in Oak's Lab**: Moved starter Poké Balls one tile down so they appear ON the table instead of floating above it
- **Starter selection flow**: Player must now talk to Prof. Oak first (sets `oakOfferedStarter` flag), then walk to the Poké Balls on the table and interact with them to trigger starter selection. Interacting with the balls before talking to Oak shows a hint message.

### Added
- **25 new NPC trainers** across all routes and gyms, with story-fitting dialogue:
  - **Route 1**: Added Lass Janice and Youngster Ben (previously defined but unspawned)
  - **Route 2**: Added Youngster Tim, Lass Mira, and Camper Ethan — hint at Crystal Cavern and Synthesis activity
  - **Viridian Forest**: Added Bug Catcher Leo (references Synthesis sensor device) and Lass Violet
  - **Crystal Cavern**: Added Hiker Garrett (warns about ley line disturbance) and Camper Felix
  - **Pewter Gym**: Added Camper Liam as junior gym trainer
  - **Route 3**: Added Swimmer Lydia (notices reef changes), Fisherman Barney, and Sailor Craig (reports mystery boats)
  - **Coral Gym**: Added Swimmer Nami as second gym trainer
  - **Route 4**: Added Hiker Mason, Youngster Drake, and Synthesis Grunt (guards ridge with story dialogue)
  - **Ember Mines**: Added additional Synthesis Grunt before Dr. Vex
  - **Route 5**: Added Camper Rosa, Youngster Miles, and Synthesis Grunt (collecting Aether from old-growth forest)
  
### Changed
- **Ironvale Gym**: Replaced reused Hiker with unique Black Belt Koji and Foundry Worker Gil (steel/forge themed)
- **Verdantia Gym**: Replaced reused Lass with unique Beauty Lily and Picnicker Daisy (nature themed)
- **Voltara Gym**: Replaced reused Youngster with unique Engineers Watts and Tesla (electric/tech themed)
- Total trainer spawns increased from 25 to 48 across the game

### Fixed
- **Player hidden under tall grass**: Player was at depth 0 (same as ground), so foreground overlays like tall grass (depth 2) completely covered them. Set player depth to 1 — body visible with grass overlaying feet, matching classic Pokémon.

### Added
- **Quit to title**: New "QUIT" option in the pause menu with a Yes/No confirmation dialog. Stops the overworld and returns to the title screen.
- **Delete save data**: New "Delete Save" option on the title screen (only shown when a save exists). Uses a Yes/No confirmation, then removes the save from localStorage and refreshes the title screen.
- **Trainer sprites in battle**: During trainer battles, the enemy trainer sprite appears behind their Pokémon (upper-right, semi-transparent) and the player character appears behind theirs (lower-left). Both slide in during the intro animation. Uses the trainer's `spriteKey` from trainer data.

### Changed
- **Trainer LoS battle trigger**: Trainers now walk toward the player (step-by-step tween) after the `!` exclamation mark, stopping 1 tile away before initiating dialogue — matching classic Pokémon behavior.
- **Wall-blocked line of sight**: Trainer `isInLineOfSight()` now checks for solid tiles between the trainer and player. A wall, tree, or boulder blocks vision so trainers can't see through obstacles.

### Fixed
- **Oak's Lab exit blocked**: Moved lab machines from center (tile 6,10) to sides (tiles 3,10 and 9,10) so the player can walk straight down to the exit mat.
- **Oak's Lab exit warp width**: Widened exit warp from 1 tile to 3 tiles (positions 5–7 on row 11) for easier navigation.

### Added
- **Phase 5 — Route 4 (Basalt Ridge)**: 20×30 volcanic route with cliffs, cave floor, Rook story NPC, Synthesis grunt encounter. Encounter table (Sandshrew, Geodude, Machop, Growlithe, Ponyta, Onix).
- **Phase 5 — Ember Mines**: 20×25 dungeon with mine tracks, boulders. 2 Synthesis grunts + Dr. Vex boss battle #1. Story NPCs: data terminal, caged Pokémon. Encounter table (Zubat, Geodude, Graveler, Koffing, Grimer, Magmar).
- **Phase 5 — Ironvale City**: 25×30 industrial town with PokéCenter, PokéMart, Gym 3 (Steel — Ferris). NPCs: Miner Gil (Mine Clearance quest), Aldric hologram (story), Professor Willow kidnapping event.

## [2026-04-12]
### Added
- **Phase 4.5 — 42 new tile types** (IDs 68–109): Coastal, Volcanic, Mine, Industrial, Forest, Electric, Ghost/Ruin, Dragon, Fire, Synthesis HQ, Post-game, League. All with colors, solid flags, overlays, foreground tiles, char mappings.
- **Battle background system**: `MapDefinition.battleBg` + `BattleScene` image-based bg with procedural fallback. Passed through wild + trainer encounters.
- **Phase 5 — Route 3 (Tide Pool Path)**: 20×40 coastal route, 3 trainers, encounter + fishing tables (Spearow, Ekans, Sandshrew, Mankey, Staryu, Horsea, Lapras).
- **Phase 5 — Coral Harbor**: 25×30 port town with PokéCenter, PokéMart, Gym 2 (Water — Coral), docks. NPCs: Captain Stern, Diver Lena, Chef Marco, disguised Zara Lux.

- **Pewter City east exit** to Route 3 with warps and spawn point.

### Fixed
- **Mobile D-pad buttons not working**: Rewrote TouchControls to use native DOM touchstart/mousedown events with manual hit-testing instead of Phaser's per-object interactive handlers inside containers. Phaser's hit-testing fails on interactive objects nested inside `setScrollFactor(0)` containers — the native approach bypasses this entirely and works reliably on all touch devices.
- **Settings scene unusable on mobile**: Added tappable ◀/▶ arrow buttons for each setting row, invisible hit areas for row selection, and a visible [ Back ] button. Settings hint text now shows touch-friendly instructions on mobile devices.
- **Keyboard-only hint texts**: Updated hint text across all scenes to detect touch devices and show appropriate instructions (e.g., "Tap to select" instead of "Press Enter to select", "A = Talk | B = Menu" instead of "ENTER = Talk | ESC = Menu").

### Added
- **MenuController.bindInteractive()**: New method to wire pointer events on game objects for hover/click support, making menus touch-friendly without manual per-item handlers.
- **Mobile/Touch Controls architecture section**: Added documentation to `docs/architecture.md` explaining how TouchControls, InputManager, and MenuController collaborate for mobile input.

## [2026-04-12]
### Fixed
- **Can't enter Oak's Lab**: Lab door 'E' in Pallet Town was at col 12 but warp expected col 11. Fixed lab door row to place E at col 11. Also fixed row 3 (walls+windows) which was 27 chars instead of 25 due to window char insertion error.
- **Player renders above tall grass**: Added `FOREGROUND_TILES` set for tiles that should render ABOVE the player (depth 2). Tall grass, trees, dense trees, and biome tree variants now draw in front of the player sprite, creating the classic Pokemon "walking through grass" visual.
- **Chair not blocking movement**: Added CHAIR and PLANT to SOLID_TILES so they properly block player movement.
- **Overlay depth system**: Ground overlays (doors, flowers, signs, mats, rugs, furniture) render at depth 0.5 (below player at depth 1). Foreground overlays (tall grass, trees) render at depth 2 (above player).

### Added
- **Comprehensive storyline bible** (`docs/storyline.md`): Full narrative document with 4-act structure, detailed character profiles (Kael, Marina, Rook, Aldric, Dr. Vex, Zara Lux), 8 Gym Leaders, Elite Four, 12 side quests with rewards, NPC interaction tables for every town, post-game content (Shattered Isles, legendaries, Father's Trail quest), and dialogue tone guide.
- **Phase 4.5 asset plan** in `docs/plan.md`: 42 new tile types (IDs 68–109) across 10 biome sets (Coastal, Volcanic, Mine, Industrial, Forest, Electric, Ghost/Ruin, Dragon, Collective HQ, League); 24 battle backgrounds; 19 NPC sprites; 20 music tracks — all mapped to specific phases and locations.

### Changed
- **Updated development plan** (`docs/plan.md`): Added new Phase 4.5 (Art Assets & Tileset Expansion) with complete tile, background, sprite, and music inventories; expanded storyline summary with character list and side quest references; updated Phase 3.6 (6 Kael encounters + 4 Marina encounters), Phase 3.7 (12 side quests); expanded Phase 5 with per-map tile and asset requirements; rewrote Phase 8 with full Act 3/4/post-game breakdown and asset lists.

## [2026-04-12]
### Fixed
- **House windows displaying as water**: Uppercase 'W' in Pallet Town house walls mapped to WATER tile. Added HOUSE_WINDOW (60), LAB_WINDOW (61), CENTER_WINDOW (62) exterior window tiles. Fixed Pallet Town, Viridian City, Pewter City maps.
- **Doors, trees, flowers with opaque backgrounds**: Made tree, flower, and all 5 door tiles (house/lab/center/mart/gym) use transparent backgrounds. Added doors to OVERLAY_BASE so their wall type renders underneath. Trees show grass through trunk gaps, flowers sit on grass, doors show wall texture behind them.
- Move category indicators (P/S/St) and type color dots no longer linger on screen after closing the move menu
- ESC key no longer exits battle from the action menu; only the RUN action can flee

### Added
- **21 new location-specific tile types** (tiles 39-59) expanding the tileset from 39 to 60 tiles:
  - **House**: TV (39), bed (40), potted plant (41), stairs (42)
  - **PokéCenter**: pink/white checkered floor (43), pink service counter (44)
  - **PokéMart**: blue/white commercial tile floor (45), merchandise shelf with colored items (46)
  - **Lab**: white tile floor (47), lab equipment/machine with green screen (48)
  - **Museum**: glass display case (49), fossil on pedestal (50)
  - **Gym**: rocky arena floor (51), boulder obstacle (52), battle arena markings (53)
  - **Overworld**: sand (54), small rock (55), bush (56), cliff face (57), cave floor (58), cave wall (59)
- All new overlay tiles use transparent backgrounds for proper compositing with their base floor tiles

- **Two-layer tile rendering with overlay compositing**: Added `OVERLAY_BASE` mapping in `shared.ts` that defines which tiles are "overlay objects" that should have a base ground tile rendered underneath. Overworld overlays (trees, tall grass, flowers, signs, fences, ledges, dense trees) render grass below. Interior overlays (tables, chairs, pokeballs, rugs, mats, PCs, heal machines, gym statues, bookshelves, counters) render floor below. Windows render indoor wall below. Tileset images for overlay tiles now have transparent backgrounds so the base tile shows through. `drawMap()` draws the base layer at depth 0, overlay tiles at depth 0.5, and NPCs at depth 1 for proper layering.

### Changed
- **PokéCenter interiors** (Viridian, Pewter): Now use pink checkered CENTER_FLOOR tiles and PINK_COUNTER instead of generic wood floor/counter. Distinctive healing station feel.
- **PokéMart interior** (Viridian): Now uses blue MART_FLOOR tiles and MART_SHELF with colorful merchandise instead of generic bookshelves.
- **Oak's Lab interior**: Now uses white LAB_FLOOR tiles with lab machine, giving it a scientific laboratory feel.
- **Pewter Gym interior**: Now uses ROCK_FLOOR with BOULDER obstacles and ARENA_MARK battle lines instead of generic gym floor.
- **Pewter Museum interior**: Now uses DISPLAY_CASE and FOSSIL tiles instead of generic bookshelves.
- **Player's House**: Added TV and potted plant for a cozier home feel.

### Fixed
- **Grass tile showing cliff edge**: The grass tile (Tile 0) was using Tuxemon tileset position (4,0) which has a brown cliff/ledge border in the corner — it's a terrain edge tile, not flat grass. Replaced with position (5,5) which is the actual clean flat grass pattern. Also fixed 4 overlay tiles (tree, tall grass, sign, ledge) that used the same bad tile as their base. Replaced water tile (had dirt edge from Tuxemon pond border) with a custom clean blue tile with wave pattern.

- **Interior map centering**: Small interior maps (Oak's Lab, houses, etc.) now render centered in the game window instead of anchored to the top-left corner. Fixed by using direct camera scroll offset instead of `setBounds`+`centerOn` which couldn't scroll past the small map bounds. Added dark background color for the area outside the map.

- **Building entry warp blocking**: Players can now enter buildings before receiving a starter Pokémon. The "You should go see Prof. Oak first!" message now only blocks route exits, not building doors. Previously all warps were blocked when the party was empty, making it impossible to enter Oak's Lab to receive a starter.
- **Pallet Town tile alignment**: Complete rewrite of Pallet Town map grid. Fixed north exit from single P to proper PP (2-wide). Connected house door paths to the main horizontal path (path now spans col 5-20). Fixed Oak's Lab wall gap on row 12 (was 12 tiles instead of 13). All 20 rows now exactly 25 characters matching declared width.
- **Map width consistency**: Normalized all exterior map row widths to match declared dimensions. Fixed viridian-city (rows were 31-32, now all 30), pewter-city (mixed 30/32, now all 30), viridian-forest (rows were 24, now all 25), route-2 (2 rows were 22, now 20).
- **Pewter City warp positions**: Corrected door warp coordinates to match actual tile positions after width normalization — PokéCenter door at col 11, Gym door at col 15, Museum door at col 12.

### Changed
- **Tileset quality upgrade v2**: Using Tuxemon tileset by Buch (CC-BY 3.0) for grass terrain — clean Pokemon Gold/Silver-style green grass with subtle diagonal pattern. Custom warm dirt path tile matching the grass palette. Custom Pokemon-style tall grass with V-shaped blade pattern on grass base. Hand-drawn tree with trunk/canopy on grass base. Buildings and interior tiles refined with proper pixel art shading. Previous ArMM1998 CC0 tiles replaced where they didn't match the Pokemon art direction.

### Added
- **Tileset-Based Map Rendering — Replaced Procedural Rectangles with Sprite Tileset**
  - Generated a clean 16×16 pixel art tileset (`tileset.png`) with all 39 tile types in Pokemon GBA style: grass with checkered pattern, textured paths, blade-pattern tall grass, trees with trunk/canopy, wave-pattern water, brick-pattern house walls, shingle-line roofs, detailed doors with doorknobs, fences with posts/rails, multi-color flowers, signs, ledges, PokéCenter roof with white cross, Mart roof with "M", Gym roof with star, wood-plank floors, baseboard walls, counters, tables, bookshelves with colored books, patterned rugs, exit mats, PC with monitor/keyboard, heal machine, cross-pane windows, chairs, Poké Ball items, stone gym floors, gym statues
  - PreloadScene loads `tileset.png` as a Phaser spritesheet (16×16 frames, 10 columns × 4 rows)
  - OverworldScene `drawMap()` replaced: ~430 lines of procedural rectangle/circle drawing reduced to ~15 lines using `this.add.image()` with tileset frame index, rendered at 2× scale for 32px game tiles
  - Massive reduction in scene object count: each tile is now 1 sprite instead of 2–15 overlapping shapes

- **Phase 3.1-3.4: Side Content**
  - **Fishing System**: 3 rod tiers (Old/Good/Super Rod) as key items, per-route fishing encounter tables (`fishingTables` in encounter-tables.ts) with weighted species, fishing interaction when facing water tiles in OverworldScene, 50% bite rate, dialogue sequence ("...!", "Not even a nibble...")
  - **Day/Night Cycle**: GameClock (`frontend/src/systems/GameClock.ts`) with 10× accelerated time (1 real min = 10 game min), 4 time periods (morning/day/evening/night) with camera tint colors, HH:MM clock, save/restore elapsed minutes
  - **Shiny Pokémon**: `isShiny` field on PokemonInstance, 1/4096 chance in `createWildPokemon`, sparkle particle effect on battle intro (6 rotating sparkles), shiny ★ star on Summary screen species name
  - **Pokédex Scene**: Full `PokedexScene` with scrollable 151-species list, seen/caught status (●/○), detail panel with sprite + types + base stats (caught only), registered in game-config and accessible via POKEDEX in pause menu
  - New constants: `SHINY_CHANCE`, `FISHING_ENCOUNTER_RATE`
  - Rod items added to item-data (old-rod, good-rod, super-rod)

- **Phase 7: Mobile & Accessibility — COMPLETE**
  - **TouchControls** (`frontend/src/ui/TouchControls.ts`): Virtual D-pad (bottom-left) + A/B buttons (bottom-right) as Phaser GameObjects. Auto-detected via `navigator.maxTouchPoints`. D-pad emits directional input, A = confirm, B = cancel. Responsive layout on resize. Integrated into InputManager (touch direction/confirm/cancel merged with keyboard).
  - **Accessibility settings in SettingsScene**: Text Size (small/medium/large), Colorblind Mode (off/protanopia/deuteranopia), Reduced Motion toggle. All persisted to localStorage via GameManager settings.
  - **PWA Support**: `manifest.json` (standalone display, landscape orientation, theme color #ffcc00, app icons), `sw.js` service worker (cache-first for assets, network-first for HTML, cache cleanup on activation). `index.html` updated with manifest link, theme-color meta, apple-mobile-web-app meta, `touch-action: none`, viewport `user-scalable=no`, and SW registration script.
  - Responsive scaling already existed (Phaser.Scale.FIT + CENTER_BOTH)

- **Pokémon Catching — Full Implementation**
  - BattleUIScene: BAG now passes `battleMode: true` to InventoryScene; listens for `use-pokeball` event to trigger catch sequence
  - Catch sequence: CatchCalculator computes catch/shakes from HP%, status, ball multiplier → ball throw arc animation → 0-3 shake wobble animations with SFX → success (sparkle + add to party/PC + Pokédex + victory BGM) or failure (break-free message + enemy free attack)
  - InventoryScene: accepts `battleMode` flag; Poké Ball USE in battle emits `use-pokeball` event with ball item ID, consumes ball from bag, and closes
  - Trainer battles block catching ("You can't catch a trainer's Pokémon!")
  - Uses all existing infrastructure: CatchCalculator, BALL_THROW/BALL_SHAKE/CATCH_SUCCESS SFX keys, addToParty with auto-deposit, markCaught for Pokédex

- **Map UI Overhaul — Enhanced Tile Rendering + Building Interiors**
  - **Enhanced procedural tile rendering**: Replaced flat-color rectangles with multi-layered detail for all 25 overworld tile types. Trees now have trunk + canopy circles + shadow. Paths have pebble texture and edge darkening. Buildings have shingle lines on roofs, brick patterns on walls, door frames with doorknobs and steps. Water has wave highlights and sparkles. Tall grass has 5 blade layers with flower accents. Flowers have stems and colored petals. Signs have post + board detail. Fences have posts + rails. Dense trees have overlapping dark canopy circles.
  - **14 new interior tile types** in `shared.ts`: FLOOR (wood planks), INDOOR_WALL (with baseboard), COUNTER, TABLE, BOOKSHELF (with colored books), RUG (patterned), MAT (exit warp), PC_TILE (monitor + keyboard), HEAL_MACHINE, WINDOW (cross-pane glass), CHAIR, POKEBALL_ITEM, GYM_FLOOR (rocky texture), GYM_STATUE (pedestal + statue)
  - **8 interior maps** with full NPC placement and gameplay logic:
    - `pallet-player-house` (8×8): Table, bookshelf, rug, Mom NPC with flag-gated dialogue
    - `pallet-rival-house` (8×8): Rival's sister NPC, furniture
    - `pallet-oak-lab` (13×12): Bookshelves, lab desks, starter Poké Balls on table, Prof. Oak + 2 lab aides (starter-select + parcel delivery logic moved inside)
    - `viridian-pokecenter` (13×8): Healing counter, Nurse NPC (heal interaction), PC terminal, benches
    - `viridian-pokemart` (10×8): Shop counter, Clerk NPC (parcel quest), shelves, shopper NPC
    - `pewter-pokecenter` (13×8): Same layout as Viridian, Nurse NPC
    - `pewter-gym` (14×12): Rocky gym floor, Brock trainer at back, gym guide NPC, statues
    - `pewter-museum` (14×10): Display cases (bookshelves), guide/scientist/visitor NPCs
  - **Door warp system**: Players can now enter buildings by stepping on door tiles. Warps added to Pallet Town (player house, rival house, Oak's lab), Viridian City (PokéCenter, PokéMart), and Pewter City (PokéCenter, gym, museum). Each interior has a MAT tile that warps back to the exterior.
  - **Door open SFX**: `sfx-door-open.wav` plays when entering/exiting buildings (detected via door/mat tile types)
  - **Interior camera**: Small interior maps that fit on screen use a centered fixed camera instead of following the player
  - **Location name popup**: Entering an interior shows a fade-in/fade-out popup with the building name (e.g., "Oak's Laboratory", "Pokémon Center")
  - **MapDefinition extensions**: Added `isInterior` flag (smaller camera, no encounters) and `displayName` field
  - **BGM mappings**: PokéCenter interiors play `bgm-pokemon-center`, Pewter Gym plays `bgm-battle-gym`

### Changed
- NPCs moved from exterior to interior maps: Mom (→ player house), Prof. Oak + starter logic (→ Oak's lab), Nurse Joy (→ PokéCenter interiors), Mart Clerk + parcel quest (→ PokéMart interior), Brock + gym guide (→ Pewter Gym interior)
- Pallet Town, Viridian City, Pewter City exterior maps updated with door warps and return spawn points

- **Phase 2: Gameplay Depth — Battle System Expansion — COMPLETE**
  - **HeldItemHandler** (`frontend/src/battle/HeldItemHandler.ts`): Held item effect system with hooks for end-of-turn (Leftovers, Black Sludge), after-damage (Focus Sash survive at 1 HP), attack-landed (Life Orb recoil), status-applied (Lum Berry, type-specific cure berries), HP-threshold (Sitrus Berry, Oran Berry), and damage modifiers (Life Orb 1.3×, Choice Band/Specs 1.5×, Muscle Band 1.1×, Wise Glasses 1.1×). Berries consumed on use, permanent items persist.
  - **WeatherManager** (`frontend/src/battle/WeatherManager.ts`): Battle weather system with 4 conditions (Sun, Rain, Sandstorm, Hail), 5-turn default duration, damage multipliers (Sun: Fire ×1.5/Water ×0.5, Rain: Water ×1.5/Fire ×0.5), end-of-turn damage for Sandstorm/Hail (1/16 HP with type immunities), weather tick/expiry, weather indicator in battle UI
  - **Multi-condition evolution**: Updated evolution-data.ts type signature to use `EvolutionCondition` discriminated union supporting level, item, trade, friendship, location, and move-known conditions. Added `ExperienceCalculator.checkLevelUpEvolution()` for unified evolution checking (level + friendship + move-known). Friendship gains on level-up (+2-5 based on current friendship), friendship loss on faint (-1).
  - **Held items in item-data**: Added Leftovers, Life Orb, Choice Band, Choice Specs, Focus Sash, Sitrus Berry, Oran Berry, Lum Berry, Cheri/Rawst/Aspear/Chesto/Pecha berries, and evolution stones (Fire/Water/Thunder/Leaf/Moon Stone)
  - **DamageCalculator integration**: Now applies ability-based immunity checks, ability damage modifiers, held item damage modifiers, and weather damage multipliers
  - **BattleManager integration**: Stores and exposes WeatherManager instance, cleans up on battle end
  - **BattleUIScene integration**: Ability onAfterDamage hooks (contact effects), held item hooks (Life Orb recoil, Focus Sash, status berries, HP threshold berries) after each move, ability/held item/weather end-of-turn effects, weather tick with expiry messages, weather indicator display
  - **Summary screen**: Shows Ability and Held Item on INFO tab
  - AbilityHandler already existed with onSwitchIn, onAfterDamage, onEndOfTurn, modifyDamage, checkImmunity hooks (created by prior agent)
  - **2.5 Expanded Move Effects**: Weather-setting moves (Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Sandstorm, Hail), Protect/Detect with +4 priority and consecutive-use success decay, two-turn moves (Fly, Dig, Solar Beam, Skull Bash, Sky Attack, Razor Wind) with charge-then-attack mechanic and auto-execute on next turn. StatusEffectHandler extended with protect state, protectSuccessRate, twoTurnCharging fields. MoveExecutor handles protect blocking, weather setting via WeatherManager, and two-turn charge/attack flow.

### Added
- **Complete Gen 1 Pokédex (151 Pokémon)** — Expanded from ~44 to all 151 original Pokémon with accurate base stats, learnsets, abilities, catch rates, exp yields, and evolution chains
- **Data folder restructure: pokemon/** — Split `pokemon-data.ts` into `data/pokemon/` folder with per-primary-type files: `normal.ts` (22), `water.ts` (28), `poison.ts` (14), `grass.ts` (12), `fire.ts` (12), `bug.ts` (12), `electric.ts` (9), `rock.ts` (9), `ground.ts` (8), `psychic.ts` (8), `fighting.ts` (7), `ghost.ts` (3), `dragon.ts` (3), `fairy.ts` (2), `ice.ts` (2), and barrel `index.ts`
- **Complete evolution data** — All Gen 1 evolution chains including level-up, stone evolutions (fire/water/thunder/moon/leaf), and trade evolutions

### Changed
- **Data folder restructure: maps/** — Split monolithic `map-data.ts` into `data/maps/` folder with individual files per map (`pallet-town.ts`, `route-1.ts`, `viridian-city.ts`, `route-2.ts`, `viridian-forest.ts`, `pewter-city.ts`), shared tile constants/interfaces in `shared.ts`, and barrel `index.ts`. Import path changed from `@data/map-data` to `@data/maps`
- **Data folder restructure: moves/** — Split monolithic `move-data.ts` (~165 moves) into `data/moves/` folder with per-type files (`normal.ts`, `fire.ts`, `water.ts`, `electric.ts`, `grass.ts`, `ice.ts`, `fighting.ts`, `poison.ts`, `ground.ts`, `flying.ts`, `psychic.ts`, `bug.ts`, `rock.ts`, `ghost.ts`, `dragon.ts`, `dark.ts`) and barrel `index.ts`. Import path changed from `@data/move-data` to `@data/moves`
- Updated all source and test imports to use new paths
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` folder structure to reflect new layout

### Removed
- `frontend/src/data/map-data.ts` (replaced by `data/maps/`)
- `frontend/src/data/move-data.ts` (replaced by `data/moves/`)
- `frontend/src/data/pokemon-data.ts` (replaced by `data/pokemon/`)

## [2026-04-12]
### Fixed
- Fullscreen toggle in Settings now correctly shows ON/OFF — `scale.isFullscreen` is async so the UI was always reading the stale value; now tracks state locally

### Added
- **Phase 1: UI Overhaul & Foundation — COMPLETE**
  - **NinePatchPanel** (`frontend/src/ui/NinePatchPanel.ts`): Procedural nine-patch panel component with rounded corners, drop shadow, inner highlight, configurable fill/border/corner radius. Replaces flat `drawPanel()` rectangles across all menus
  - **MenuController** (`frontend/src/ui/MenuController.ts`): Unified input controller for 1D/2D menu grids — keyboard (arrows, WASD, Enter/Space/Z confirm, ESC/X cancel), mouse hover-to-select and click-to-confirm, wrap-around navigation, audio feedback hooks, disabled state for animation blocking
  - **Dialogue System Upgrade**: Speaker name panel with highlighted label, per-character typewriter SFX (blip every 2 chars), animated bouncing ▼ advance indicator, inline choice prompts (Yes/No rendered inside dialogue box with cursor navigation), nine-patch bordered dialogue boxes
  - **Inventory Scene (Full Implementation)**: Complete bag screen with 5 category tabs (Medicine, Poké Balls, Battle, Key Items, TMs), scrollable item list with scroll indicators, detail panel showing description/effect/quantity, USE action (heals HP, cures status with party target picker), TOSS action with confirmation, key items protected from toss, money display, Q/E tab switching
  - **Battle UI Polish**: Nine-patch panels for message bar and action menu, move type color dots and category indicators (P/S/St) in move selection, PP coloring (white normal, yellow ≤25%, red empty), floating damage number popups that rise and fade with effectiveness-based coloring, themed info boxes with consistent dark card styling
  - **Party Screen Improvements**: Context menu on slot select (SUMMARY/SWITCH/Cancel), SWITCH mode for party reordering (tap source then destination), fainted Pokémon slots visually dimmed with FNT badge, mini-sprite icons if texture loaded, NinePatchPanel background
  - **Settings Scene** (`frontend/src/scenes/SettingsScene.ts`): Accessible from Title Screen and Pause Menu "Options", settings: Text Speed (slow/medium/fast/instant), Music Volume slider (0-100%), SFX Volume slider (0-100%), Battle Animations toggle, Fullscreen toggle. Left/Right to adjust, persisted to localStorage, audio changes applied in real-time
  - **GameManager settings**: New `settings` property with `getSettings()`/`getSetting()`/`setSetting()` methods, settings persisted in localStorage independently and included in save serialization, loaded on singleton construction
  - Registered `SettingsScene` in game config scene list

### Changed
- `DialogueScene` now accepts `DialogueData` interface with optional `speaker`, `choices`, and `onChoice` fields
- `MenuScene` uses NinePatchPanel instead of drawPanel; OPTIONS opens SettingsScene
- `TitleScene` OPTIONS launches SettingsScene as overlay
- `BattleScene` info boxes use themed COLORS.bgCard/border instead of hardcoded hex
- `BattleUIScene` action menu and move menu use NinePatchPanel, FONTS, and COLORS consistently

## [2026-04-12]
### Fixed
- ESC key now opens the pause menu — `InputManager` was calling `JustDown` twice on the same ESC key object, so `cancel` consumed the event before `menu` could read it; now evaluates once and shares the result
- Professor Oak no longer repeats starter selection dialogue after player already received a Pokémon — `starter-select` interaction now checks `receivedStarter` flag; NPCs are respawned after starter selection so the flag-gated `pallet-oak-after` NPC replaces `pallet-oak`
- Rewrote `player-walk.json` atlas — sprite sheet is column-based (col0=down, col1=right, col2=up, col3=left) with 3 frames per direction, not row-based with 4 frames. Updated AnimationHelper to register all 4 directions (removed flipX hack for right) with correct frame range (0–2). Player now faces the correct direction when walking.
- Player walk animation no longer spins/restarts every frame — restored `repeat: -1` for continuous walk cycle during movement, removed per-frame `lastAnimKey` reset that was causing the animation to restart from frame 0 each tick

### Added
- **UI Testing — Scene State Machine & Regression Tests**
  - `overworld-animation.test.ts`: Validates animation key stability to prevent player rotation bugs — idle/walk animation resolution, facing→key mapping, rapid direction change handling
  - `battle-ui-state-machine.test.ts`: Exhaustive state×input matrix for BattleUIScene — documents ESC-exits-battle bug, tests input blocking during animation, action/move menu transitions
  - `scene-lifecycle.test.ts`: Input gating across scene overlays (menu, dialogue, battle), pause/resume correctness, transition guards, battle→overworld return sequence
  - `grid-movement.test.ts`: Pure-logic movement — collision blocking, movement locking during tweens, NPC collision, trainer line-of-sight for all 4 directions
  - `input-manager.test.ts`: Direction priority, WASD alternatives, JustDown vs isDown, shared ESC key documentation
  - `ui-regression.spec.ts` (Playwright): Idle rotation, ESC-in-battle, rapid ESC/direction stress, menu open/close/resume, save option
  - Test suite now at 1172 tests across 38 files

### Fixed
- Player walk animation no longer loops infinitely; plays once per tile move using `repeat: 0` and `duration` matching `WALK_DURATION`

### Added
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests and type-check on PRs and pushes to main
- Test step added to deploy workflow so failing tests block deployment
- **Expanded Testing Suite — 1089 tests across 33 files**
  - 15 new test files covering previously untested modules and deep scenarios
  - Extended unit tests: DamageCalculator (burn/stat stage/formula verification), StatusEffectHandler (all 11 stat stages, escalating toxic, confusion self-hit, trap timing, effect chance gating, single-status rule), AIController (power×effectiveness scoring, PP avoidance), type-chart (exhaustive 324 matchups + 48 SE + 8 immunities), data integrity (learnset sorting/dedup, starter balance, move effect validation, evolution acyclicity, route progression)
  - New unit tests: seeded-random (determinism, distribution, edge seeds), map-data (tile constants, solid tiles, colors), audio-keys (BGM/SFX keys, MAP_BGM validation), constants (all game constants)
  - Extended integration tests: full multi-turn battles, multi-pokemon party battles, trainer multi-enemy parties, priority move turn order, status accumulation over turns, every move in moveData crash-tested, every registered species createWildPokemon tested, all level-based evolutions tested, save/load field preservation (nickname, status, EVs, friendship), multi-cycle save/load
  - New integration tests: DialogueManager, full-battle-scenarios
  - Created `docs/TestingArchitecture.md` documenting all 5 test layers, test structure, coverage goals, and agent workflow
  - Updated `copilot-instructions.md` with testing section referencing TestingArchitecture.md

- **Phase 11: Deployment — GitHub Pages — COMPLETE**
  - Set Vite `base: '/Pokemon-Web/'` for correct asset paths on GitHub Pages
  - Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Actions CI/CD: checkout → Node 20 → npm ci → build → upload artifact → deploy to Pages
  - Added `npm run deploy` script (manual deploy via gh-pages package)
  - Production build verified with correct base path in output HTML

- **Phase 10: Polish & Quality of Life — COMPLETE**
  - Battle intro slide-in animation: sprites enter from offscreen (enemy from right, player from left), info boxes slide in from top/bottom with Back.easeOut easing
  - EXP bar in battle HUD: blue progress bar below player HP, animates on EXP gain with SFX
  - Battle transition screen-wipe: 3 styles (stripes, circles, fade) — battles use alternating stripe wipe effect
  - Evolution animation system: detects level-based evolution after level-up in battle, plays rapid flash sequence → white flash → sprite swap → stat recalculation, updates Pokédex
  - Configurable text speed: DialogueScene reads text speed preference (slow/medium/fast/instant), defaults to medium
  - Save game from menu: MenuScene SAVE option writes to localStorage via SaveManager, shows "Game Saved!" confirmation with fade-out
  - Continue from save: TitleScene→OverworldScene properly loads save data via GameManager.loadFromSave(), restores map position, party, flags

### Changed
  - TransitionScene rewritten with 3 transition styles and clean scene handoff
  - BattleScene sprites and info boxes now use intro animation instead of static placement
  - BattleUIScene victory sequence now checks for evolution before ending battle

- **Phase 9: Game Content — World Building — COMPLETE**
  - 4 new maps: Viridian City (30×30), Route 2 (20×30), Viridian Forest (25×40), Pewter City (30×30)
  - 10 new tile types: PokéCenter (wall/roof/door), PokéMart (wall/roof/door), Gym (wall/roof/door), Dense Tree
  - New trainers: Youngster Ben (Route 2), 3 Bug Catchers placed in Viridian Forest, Gym Leader Brock in Pewter City Gym
  - `StarterSelectScene`: overlay UI for choosing Bulbasaur/Charmander/Squirtle with card layout, sprite preview, keyboard+mouse navigation
  - Flag-gated NPC system: `NpcSpawn.requireFlag`, `flagDialogue` (alternative dialogue per flag), `setsFlag`, `interactionType`
  - Story flag flow: Oak gives starter (→ `receivedStarter`), Mart clerk gives parcel (→ `hasParcel`), Oak accepts parcel (→ `deliveredParcel`, `receivedPokedex`), Brock defeated (→ `defeatedBrock`)
  - Pokémon Center healing: fully restores HP, PP, and status for all party members
  - Trainer defeat rewards: money awarded, trainer marked defeated, Boulder Badge granted for Brock
  - Post-battle trainer messages: defeat announcement, money reward, badge, after-dialogue
  - Block warps when player has no Pokémon (directs to Oak)
  - Map transitions: Route 1 north → Viridian City, Viridian City north → Route 2, Route 2 north → Viridian Forest, Forest north → Pewter City

### Changed
  - Mom NPC dialogue is flag-gated (pre/post starter)
  - OverworldScene NPC spawning respects `requireFlag` conditions
  - BattleScene stores `isTrainerBattle` and `trainerId` from transition data
  - BattleUIScene victory sequence handles trainer rewards, money, badges, and after-dialogue
  - ExperienceCalculator now receives proper isTrainer flag for trainer battles

- **Comprehensive Testing System (All 5 Phases)**
  - **Phase 1 — Unit Tests (Vitest):** DamageCalculator, CatchCalculator, ExperienceCalculator, type-chart, BattleStateMachine, StatusEffectHandler, AIController, math-helpers, and full data integrity tests
  - **Phase 2 — Integration Tests:** GameManager (party, bag, money, badges, serialize/deserialize), SaveManager round-trip, BattleManager full battle flow, MoveExecutor (all move types), EncounterSystem, EventManager, evolution, inventory
  - **Phase 3 — E2E Tests (Playwright):** Boot-to-title smoke test, console error check, new game flow, menu navigation
  - **Phase 4 — Deterministic Replay System:** Seeded PRNG (mulberry32), replay runner, replay types/format, starter battle replay JSON
  - **Phase 5 — Fuzz/Monkey Testing:** Seeded random input generator, 2000-input crash test with periodic screenshots
  - Vitest config with path aliases matching the project's Vite config
  - Phaser mock and localStorage mock utilities for Node-based testing
  - 255 tests across 18 test files, all passing
  - `npm run test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:watch`, `test:e2e`, `test:fuzz`, `test:coverage`, `test:all` scripts
  - `frontend/src/utils/seeded-random.ts` — mulberry32 PRNG for deterministic replay

- **Status Effect System — Full Wiring**
  - Type-based status immunities: Fire immune to burn, Electric to paralysis, Poison/Steel to poison, Ice to freeze, Grass to Leech Seed
  - Fire-type move thawing: fire moves now thaw frozen targets before dealing damage
  - Leech Seed effect: drains 1/8 max HP per turn and heals the opponent, with Grass-type immunity
  - Trapping move effects for Wrap, Bind, Fire Spin, and Clamp: deal 1/8 HP per turn for 4–5 turns
  - Status condition indicators (BRN, PAR, PSN, SLP, FRZ) displayed on battle HUD with color coding
  - `StatusEffectHandler` integrated into `BattleManager` as single source of truth
  - `BattleManager.selectMove()` now uses StatusEffectHandler for stat stages, priority, status turn-start checks, flinch, and end-of-turn effects
  - `BattleManager.switchPokemon()` now clears volatile statuses on switch-out and initializes new active
  - `BattleManager.cleanup()` method for proper teardown
  - `BattleManager.getStatusHandler()` exposes the handler for UI integration
  - `MoveExecutor` now passes thaw messages through all return paths (OHKO, fixed-damage, level-damage, multi-hit, standard)

### Changed
  - `BattleUIScene` now uses `BattleManager.getStatusHandler()` instead of creating its own StatusEffectHandler
  - `StatusEffectHandler.applyEndOfTurn()` accepts optional opponent parameter for Leech Seed healing
  - `VolatileStatus` type expanded with `'leech-seed' | 'trapped'`
  - `MoveEffect.type` union expanded with `'leech-seed' | 'trap'`
  - `BattlePokemonState` tracks `trapTurns` for trapping move duration
  - Updated end-of-turn flow in `BattleUIScene` to pass opponent reference for Leech Seed

- **Phase 7: Audio System — COMPLETE**
  - Enhanced `AudioManager` singleton with browser autoplay policy handling (queues BGM until user interaction unlocks audio), safe playback (missing audio keys don't crash), current BGM tracking (avoids replaying same track), fade-out method, mute toggle, volume clamping
  - Created `utils/audio-keys.ts` with typed BGM/SFX key constants and map→BGM mapping table
  - Generated 8 placeholder BGM WAV files (title, pallet-town, route, battle-wild, battle-trainer, battle-gym, victory, pokemon-center) using synthesized square-wave melodies
  - Generated 16 placeholder SFX WAV files (cursor, confirm, cancel, error, hit-normal, hit-super, hit-weak, hit-crit, faint, ball-throw, ball-shake, catch-success, exp-fill, level-up, door-open, ledge-jump, bump, encounter)
  - Audio preloading in `PreloadScene` for all BGM and SFX keys
  - BGM wired into `TitleScene` (title theme), `OverworldScene` (per-map BGM with crossfade on map transition), `BattleScene` (wild/trainer battle themes)
  - Victory BGM plays on battle win in `BattleUIScene`
  - SFX wired into `TitleScene` (cursor/confirm), `MenuScene` (cursor/confirm/cancel), `BattleUIScene` (cursor/confirm/cancel, hit variants based on type effectiveness and crits, faint, level-up), `OverworldScene` (encounter sting)

### Fixed
- Battle→Overworld return flow now properly passes `returnScene`/`returnData` through `BattleScene` so the player returns to the correct map and position after battle (previously defaulted to GameManager state which worked by coincidence)
