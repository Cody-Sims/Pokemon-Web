## [2026-04-12]
### Added
- **Comprehensive Testing System (All 5 Phases)**
  - **Phase 1 — Unit Tests (Vitest):** DamageCalculator, CatchCalculator, ExperienceCalculator, type-chart, BattleStateMachine, StatusEffectHandler, AIController, math-helpers, and full data integrity tests
  - **Phase 2 — Integration Tests:** GameManager (party, bag, money, badges, serialize/deserialize), SaveManager round-trip, BattleManager full battle flow, MoveExecutor (all move types), EncounterSystem, EventManager, evolution, inventory
  - **Phase 3 — E2E Tests (Playwright):** Boot-to-title smoke test, console error check, new game flow, menu navigation
  - **Phase 4 — Deterministic Replay System:** Seeded PRNG (mulberry32), replay runner, replay types/format, starter battle replay JSON
  - **Phase 5 — Fuzz/Monkey Testing:** Seeded random input generator, 2000-input crash test with periodic screenshots
  - Vitest config with path aliases matching the project's Vite config
  - Phaser mock and localStorage mock utilities for Node-based testing
  - 255 tests across 18 test files, all passing
  - `npm run test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:watch`, `test:e2e`, `test:fuzz`, `test:coverage`, `test:all` scripts
  - `frontend/src/utils/seeded-random.ts` — mulberry32 PRNG for deterministic replay

- **Status Effect System — Full Wiring**
  - Type-based status immunities: Fire immune to burn, Electric to paralysis, Poison/Steel to poison, Ice to freeze, Grass to Leech Seed
  - Fire-type move thawing: fire moves now thaw frozen targets before dealing damage
  - Leech Seed effect: drains 1/8 max HP per turn and heals the opponent, with Grass-type immunity
  - Trapping move effects for Wrap, Bind, Fire Spin, and Clamp: deal 1/8 HP per turn for 4–5 turns
  - Status condition indicators (BRN, PAR, PSN, SLP, FRZ) displayed on battle HUD with color coding
  - `StatusEffectHandler` integrated into `BattleManager` as single source of truth
  - `BattleManager.selectMove()` now uses StatusEffectHandler for stat stages, priority, status turn-start checks, flinch, and end-of-turn effects
  - `BattleManager.switchPokemon()` now clears volatile statuses on switch-out and initializes new active
  - `BattleManager.cleanup()` method for proper teardown
  - `BattleManager.getStatusHandler()` exposes the handler for UI integration
  - `MoveExecutor` now passes thaw messages through all return paths (OHKO, fixed-damage, level-damage, multi-hit, standard)

### Changed
  - `BattleUIScene` now uses `BattleManager.getStatusHandler()` instead of creating its own StatusEffectHandler
  - `StatusEffectHandler.applyEndOfTurn()` accepts optional opponent parameter for Leech Seed healing
  - `VolatileStatus` type expanded with `'leech-seed' | 'trapped'`
  - `MoveEffect.type` union expanded with `'leech-seed' | 'trap'`
  - `BattlePokemonState` tracks `trapTurns` for trapping move duration
  - Updated end-of-turn flow in `BattleUIScene` to pass opponent reference for Leech Seed

- **Phase 7: Audio System — COMPLETE**
  - Enhanced `AudioManager` singleton with browser autoplay policy handling (queues BGM until user interaction unlocks audio), safe playback (missing audio keys don't crash), current BGM tracking (avoids replaying same track), fade-out method, mute toggle, volume clamping
  - Created `utils/audio-keys.ts` with typed BGM/SFX key constants and map→BGM mapping table
  - Generated 8 placeholder BGM WAV files (title, pallet-town, route, battle-wild, battle-trainer, battle-gym, victory, pokemon-center) using synthesized square-wave melodies
  - Generated 16 placeholder SFX WAV files (cursor, confirm, cancel, error, hit-normal, hit-super, hit-weak, hit-crit, faint, ball-throw, ball-shake, catch-success, exp-fill, level-up, door-open, ledge-jump, bump, encounter)
  - Audio preloading in `PreloadScene` for all BGM and SFX keys
  - BGM wired into `TitleScene` (title theme), `OverworldScene` (per-map BGM with crossfade on map transition), `BattleScene` (wild/trainer battle themes)
  - Victory BGM plays on battle win in `BattleUIScene`
  - SFX wired into `TitleScene` (cursor/confirm), `MenuScene` (cursor/confirm/cancel), `BattleUIScene` (cursor/confirm/cancel, hit variants based on type effectiveness and crits, faint, level-up), `OverworldScene` (encounter sting)

### Fixed
- Battle→Overworld return flow now properly passes `returnScene`/`returnData` through `BattleScene` so the player returns to the correct map and position after battle (previously defaulted to GameManager state which worked by coincidence)

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 1: Environment & Tooling Setup — COMPLETE
- Initialized project with Vite 8 + TypeScript 6 + Phaser 3
- Moved all frontend code into `frontend/` directory for future backend support
- Configured `tsconfig.json` with strict mode and path aliases (`@scenes/*`, `@data/*`, etc.)
- Configured `vite.config.ts` with matching path aliases and `frontend/` as root
- Created full folder structure per architecture.md
- Created `index.html`, `.gitignore`, `package.json` with dev/build/preview scripts
- Dev server running at `localhost:8080` with HMR

### Phase 2: Core Scenes Skeleton — COMPLETE
- Created 12 scene classes: Boot, Preload, Title, Overworld, Battle, BattleUI, Dialogue, Menu, Inventory, Party, Summary, Transition
- Scene flow: Boot → Preload (progress bar) → Title (New Game / Continue) → Overworld → Battle
- TitleScene: keyboard + mouse menu navigation, cursor indicator
- OverworldScene: placeholder grid, player movement (arrow keys + WASD), camera follow
- BattleScene + BattleUIScene: stubs with placeholder sprites, action menu
- TransitionScene: fade-to-black transitions between scenes
- MenuScene: pause overlay with Pokemon/Bag/Save/Options/Exit
- DialogueScene: typewriter text effect with advance-on-input

### Phase 3: Data Layer — COMPLETE
- Defined TypeScript interfaces: PokemonData, MoveData, ItemData, TrainerData, PokemonInstance, SaveData, etc.
- Populated ~30 Pokémon (3 starter lines, route Pokémon, gym Pokémon)
- Populated ~50 moves across all 18 types + status moves
- Populated ~15 items (Potions, Poké Balls, status heals, key items)

- StatusEffectHandler: burn, paralysis, poison, bad poison, sleep, freeze logic with damage/skip/thaw
- AIController: trainer AI prefers super-effective moves, wild Pokémon random selection
- ExperienceCalculator: EXP yield formula, level-up with stat recalculation, nature modifiers (+10%/-10%), new move learning
- CatchCalculator: catch rate formula with HP ratio, ball multiplier, status bonus, shake checks
- Nature system: 25 natures with proper stat modifiers, `getNatureMultiplier()` and `getNatureDescription()` exports

- Turn execution: speed determines order, both sides attack, damage messages, effectiveness text, crits
- HP bars animate via tweens, change color (green → yellow → red)
- Sprite flash on hit, drop+fade on faint
- EXP bar in player info box, animates on gain
- Level-up sequence: flash effect, stat display, new move prompt (auto-learn if <4, replace choice if 4)
